# QA Engineer k6 testing

This repository was based off of [k6-typescript-framework](https://github.com/go-automate/k6-typescript-framework) and all support files and instructions have been intentionally removed.

It is left up to the QA Engineer candidate to either test using javascript or try to use `k6-typescript-framework` as a reference and implement
the same project, structural and testing as is provided in that project, using the Whitebox specific API.
