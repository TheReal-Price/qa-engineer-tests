# Whitebox QA Engineer Test Docs Site

This is the main Docs WebSite for the QA Engineer Candidate Test. This project contains all the source code for a simple docs website for QA Engineer Candidates to test against. 

**This project is currently unused and is here as a placeholder**

NOTE: This project is managed via [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build) and as such should be ran in conjunction with everything in the monorepo. To that extent please see the monorepos [README](../../README.md)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3001/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
